# Clayton X SimpliSafe Take Home Assessment

## Assumptions I made
- The board would be represented by a 4x4 array of arrays
- The board would consist of moves
    - "X" represents player X in that position
    - "O" represents player O in that position
    - ""  represents no player in that position
    
## Using my code
There are three functions exported from tts.ts:
- checkWinner
- anyMovesLeft
- isGameOver

there are a series of tests in tts.test.js. You can run these tests with `npm run test`
